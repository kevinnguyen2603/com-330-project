  <h1>Nhan Nguyen: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m an international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have taken a few web development at IIT. I'm taking this class because
      it's very cool to study Hummanity but working on HTML/CSS instead of
      writing essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m doing co-terminal degree with ITM and Cybersecurity. Last semester, I have
      an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring 2020, I just
      receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m very excited to graduate in May 2020. My goal is becoming a CIO of a
      company. To achieve my goal, I will need to experience in IT security and get IT
      certificates.
