Nhan Nguyen: Background and Ambitions

Hi, my name is Nhan Nguyen, however, I also go by Kevin.

I'm an international student from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.

I'm doing co-terminal degree with ITM and Cybersecurity. Last semester, I have
an internship at Supply Clinic as a Data Analyst. For spring 2020, I just
receive an offer to work as an investigator at CFTC.

I'm very excited to graduate in May 2020. My goal is becoming a CIO of a
company. To achieve my goal, I will need to experience in IT security and get IT
certificates.
